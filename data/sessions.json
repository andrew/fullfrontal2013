      "description": "In this tutorial we'll take a deep dive into how Web Components (A collection of technologies that includes Shadow DOM, HTML Templates, Custom Elements, and HTML Imports) can be used as building blocks to construct a functioning web application.\n\nWe'll review how each of the technologies under the web components umbrella work, how they work together, and how x-tags makes use of them to make modular, lightweight components. Special attention will be given to building applications for mobile devices with environments such as Firefox OS, Chrome OS, and PhoneGap.",

      "description": "Software loves hierarchies: class hierarchies, object hierarchies, folder hierarchies, style hierarchies, menu hierachies. And yet, all but the most simple tree structures require levels of organizational foresight and intellectual rigour which mere humans rarely possess—and they usually end in tears.\n\nDrawing on a diverse range of web—based examples, and proposing alternatives along the way, I'll attempt to demonstrate how trees and nesting are great for birds, but mostly lousy for developers and users.",
