      "description": "Tired of Hello World? In this workshop, you will learn modern strategies and best practices to build native-like mobile applications with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. You'll also learn how to use PhoneGap to leverage the native capabilities of your device in JavaScript and to package your HTML application as a native app for distribution through the different app stores.",

      "extendedDescription": "With the focus on performance and architecture, this workshop will give you the keys to fast, robust, and successful PhoneGap applications.\n\nYou will build a PhoneGap application from scratch using the Single Page Architecture, HTML templates, touch events, modularization techniques, and many performance optimization techniques. We will also compare and contrast the leading JavaScript and Mobile Frameworks, and you will use the new Topcoat CSS toolkit as the basis for your application UI."

Or that you can proxy your local server through a browser configuration so your mobile phone can see it? This workshop is dedicated to learning the native developer tools baked in to the browser to make our life a little more bearable.",
      "extendedDescription": "We will look at features of Chrome DevTools, what's available in Firefox debugging suite. We'll also look at remote mobile debugging using native tools and also look at the alternative tools where native support isn't available.\n\nThe workshop will mostly be about the foundation of debugging techniques, which apply way beyond just a single browser's debugger tool, but will raise your expectation of all web debugging environments."
