<p>Hi there,</p>

<p>Please find below important and useful information to make sure your visit to the Full Frontal JavaScript Conference on Friday 8 November 2013 is super-duper!</p>

<p>Note that we&#39;ve also published all these details <a href="http://full-frontal.org/details">http://full-frontal.org/details</a></p>

<h1>Directions</h1>

<p>How to get there: <a href="http://ffconf.com/directions">http://ffconf.com/directions</a></p>

<p>Full Frontal JavaScript Conference is being held at the historic Duke of York&#39;s Picturehouse in Brighton. It is centrally located on Preston Circus, less than 15 minutes walk from Brighton train station. Trains run regularly from Gatwick Airport, London Bridge and London Victoria stations.  We recommend using <a href="http://www.traintimes.org.uk">http://www.traintimes.org.uk</a> for up to date timetables. Hotel recommendations can be found on the Full Frontal website: <a href="http://2013.full-frontal.org/#locations">http://2013.full-frontal.org/#locations</a></p>

<h1>Registration</h1>

<p>Registration opens at 9am and the conference starts at 9:40am sharp!  There are no tickets for the conference, but you must bring a form of identification (bank card, driving licence etc) to pick up your name badge/programme. Please keep this with you at all times as you will need it to get back into the conference (and into the after party).</p>

<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

<p>Note that by attending any of our events - workshops &amp; conference &amp; fringe event, you are agreeing to our code of conduct: <a href="http://confcodeofconduct.com">http://confcodeofconduct.com</a> - tl;dr: don&#39;t be a jerk.</p>

<h1>Schedule</h1>

<p>The most up to date schedule and speaker abstracts can be found on the website: <a href="http://full-frontal.org/">http://full-frontal.org/</a>. </p>

<h1>Technology</h1>

<p>If you plan to bring a laptop, make sure itâ€™s fully charged for the day, as we only have a few charging stations in the venue (up on the balcony).</p>

<p>If I said there was wifi at the venue, you&#39;d come looking for me to thump me in the head. The wifi is bad. <em>Real bad</em>. With that we would recommend either not relying on it all, put another way: IT WON&#39;T WORK! Network coverage however is very good, so you can tether your mobile phone or bring your own mifi or dongle, etc.</p>

<p>In fact, it&#39;s even been known that some people go classic old school and use a pen and paper! See: <a href="http://flic.kr/p/7hmEGJ">http://flic.kr/p/7hmEGJ</a> :)</p>

<h1>Refreshments</h1>

<p>Tea, Coffee and Danishes will be available from 9am in the upstairs bar and the ground floor. Further refreshments will be available from the same locations at the mid morning and mid afternoon breaks. Please note lunch is not included but maps are available at registration for local recommendations, some of which can be found here: <a href="http://ffconf.com/food">http://ffconf.com/food</a></p>

<h1>Photos, videos, tweets and blog posts</h1>
